#### Package

Package: In electronics, a package refers to the physical housing that contains a semiconductor device, such as a processor or memory chip. It protects the chip and provides connections (pins or balls) for it to interface with a circuit board.

#### Chip

A chip (or integrated circuit, IC) is a small piece of semiconductor material (usually silicon) on which a circuit is embedded. It can contain millions or billions of transistors and other electronic components to perform various tasks, such as processing data or storing information.

#### ISA

The ISA is the set of instructions that a processor can execute. It defines how software interacts with the hardware, specifying the machine code instructions that the CPU understands. Examples include x86, ARM, and RISC-V ISAs.
